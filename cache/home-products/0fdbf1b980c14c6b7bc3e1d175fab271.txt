Whether you start in town or on the dusty trails, the Mantra 2 makes running seem other-worldly. The mesh upper gets kept in line by external Sensifit stays. Lateral motion isn't a liability and breathability isn't an issue. Seamless Endofit on the inside wraps your paw for firm footing on any ground without the threat of stitching to thwart your soft soles. Friction-free eyelets turn the Quicklace system into a sonic-speed system. A handy lace pocket hides the extra string so you're only tripping daisies, and not all over your laces. The middle is anything but mediocre. Two discrete layers are molded into the tightly hewed racing last for a powerful combination of ground feel and paw protection. A whisper-thin layer of TPU fends off sharp sticks and prickly rocks without running interference between the earth and your foot.

The 3D Ride EVA midsole and molded EVA sockliner provide a moderate amount of cushion that will cradle your feet without weighing you down, and the 3D mesh lining wicks moisture away from your skin to keep your feet dry while you eat up the miles.";s:8:"category";s:8:" running";s:5:"price";s:6:"124.95";s:8:"merchant";s:11:"Backcountry";s:5:"brand";s:7:"Salomon";s:9:"permalink";s:128:"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deiq/running-10/salomon-x-scream-3d-running-shoe-men-s-gecko-green-bright-red-black-10-0.html";}}}s:9:"group-two";a:1:{s:9:"jerseys-1";a:12:{s:68:"gore-bike-wear-base-layer-turtleneck-shirt-long-sleeve-men-s-black-l";a:9:{s:13:"affiliate_url";s:192:"http://prosperent.com/store/product/406592-16240-0/?k=Gore+Bike+Wear+Base+Layer+Turtleneck+Shirt+-+Long-Sleeve+-+Men%27s+Black%2C+L&m=123472&b=Gore+Bike+Wear&p=331300a492c07e20f2c10478f8184030";s:9:"image_url";s:103:"http://images.prosperentcdn.com/images/250x250/www.backcountry.com/images/items/1200/GBW/GBW0327/BK.jpg";s:7:"keyword";s:73:"Gore Bike Wear Base Layer Turtleneck Shirt - Long-Sleeve - Men's Black, L";s:11:"description";s:1338:"You're not a snake, so why shed layers every time you ride?

Don't make it even harder on your body by ignoring key principles of layering. No matter what the temperature, you sweat. The harder you work, the more important moisture management becomes as even slight variations in core temperature, caused by perspiration, result in fatigue. The Gore Bike Wear WS Men's Turtleneck is a base layer designed for efficient moisture management throughout the cold months, keeping your body happy, even if your mind is curled up in front of the fire. The WS Men's Turtleneck is designed with two different fabric types to help maintain core temperature. The first is a polyester hydrophilic fabric that pulls moisture away from your body to keep skin dry. In addition, Gore uses Windstopper inserts over the chest, shoulder and kidney areas -- areas that are hit hardest by the wind. These two fabrics work together to maintain your body's core temperature, decreasing fatigue and increasing efficiency. This base layer was designed not only to regulate body temperature but also for comfort. Insert panels, made from a blend of polypropylene, elastane and nylon, ensure maximum range of motion and durability as they stretch rather than tearing. And although Gore uses as few seams as possible, when necessary, flat-lock seams are used. An extra-long back means no tugging to keep your waist from being exposed to the chill, and the zip turtleneck keeps chill out of the neckline.

For the Speed Vortex Cycling Shoes, the Italian manufacturer opts for a slightly heavier sole (by 10 grams per pair) that incorporates the same NET breathing technology found in the line-topping Vortex Pro. The soles are constructed of a synthetic mesh and breathable, impermeable membrane that increase the soles' transpiration capacity without letting moisture, mud, and other external elements in. The Speed Vortex Shoes also feature the Vortex Pro's Suprell-Tech Morpho AM Cage technology. The shoes stay tight against your feet without restricting circulation. Inside the upper, the EVA insert is perforated to further promote breathability and removable, so you can optimize your level of arch support to your own foot shape. The molded, abrasion-resistant Duratech heel cup is updated with a griping texture to keep your foot from slipping, but is also removable if your feet demand it. The closure system incorporates a Boa wire system -- almost mandatory for quality cycling shoes today -- and a hook-and-loop strap. The Boa wire lets you fine-tune the fit across the top of your foot, where the most pressure is applied to the upper, and the hook-and-loop strap lets you modulate the pressure over your metatarsal area. Anyone who's experienced crippling hot spots in the toe box will appreciate this variable approach, as it lets you customize the shoe's fit for firm support and spacious comfort at the same time.";s:8:"category";s:8:" cycling";s:5:"price";s:6:"298.95";s:8:"merchant";s:11:"Backcountry";s:5:"brand";s:7:"Diadora";s:9:"permalink";s:105:"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deiq/cycling-1/diadora-speed-vortex-cyling-shoes-white-black-42-0.html";}s:75:"diadora-x-vortex-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-men-s-black-yellow-fluo-white-43-0";a:9:{s:13:"affiliate_url";s:194:"http://prosperent.com/store/product/406592-16240-0/?k=Diadora+X-Vortex+Pro+Mountain+Bike+Shoes+-+Men%27s+Black%2FYellow+Fluo%2FWhite%2C+43.0&m=123472&b=Diadora&p=acb8e6ae6b1c9b2cfdcb1864fc6276ff";s:9:"image_url";s:107:"http://images.prosperentcdn.com/images/250x250/www.backcountry.com/images/items/1200/DIA/DIA000L/BLAFLU.jpg";s:7:"keyword";s:78:"Diadora X-Vortex Pro Mountain Bike Shoes - Men's Black/Yellow Fluo/White, 43.0";s:11:"description";s:772:"Diadora's ultra-stiff X-Vortex Pro Mountain Bike Shoes are designed to put maximum power to your pedals so can rip trails.

At first glance, the jacket looks like a stylish, thigh-length casual sweater to wear around town, but its less-obvious technical features and luxurious style details offer superior cold-weather comfort and long-lasting high quality rarely found in a round-the-town coverup. The first thing you notice about the Svolver Jacket is its beautiful knit pattern, distinctive toggle-front placket, and eye-catching fur hood trim. What is not immediately obvious is that this sweater-style jacket is made of a very special soft Norwegian merino wool that has higher bulk and strength, as well as retains more air for more insulating warmth, than other types of wool. Compared to wool-like synthetic sweater materials, this all-natural material is breathable, insulating even when wet, and inherently anti-microbial so does not hold odors. Underneath the wool, a moisture-wicking, windproof polyurethane lining guards against windchill while keeping you comfortable inside the jacket. A two-way zipper at the front of the jacket gives you the option to unzip from either the top or bottom for optimal customized temperature regulation, and the stylish toggle-front closure that overlays the zippered placket features genuine buffalo horn toggles. The hood is removable if you prefer to wear the sweater alone on warmer days, and the real raccoon fur trim is also detachable, which allows you to customize the style of the jacket to suit your preference for the day.

At first glance, the jacket looks like a stylish, thigh-length casual sweater to wear around town, but its less-obvious technical features and luxurious style details offer superior cold-weather comfort and long-lasting high quality rarely found in a round-the-town coverup. The first thing you notice about the Svolver Jacket is its beautiful knit pattern, distinctive toggle-front placket, and eye-catching fur hood trim. What is not immediately obvious is that this sweater-style jacket is made of a very special soft Norwegian merino wool that has higher bulk and strength, as well as retains more air for more insulating warmth, than other types of wool. Compared to wool-like synthetic sweater materials, this all-natural material is breathable, insulating even when wet, and inherently anti-microbial so does not hold odors. Underneath the wool, a moisture-wicking, windproof polyurethane lining guards against windchill while keeping you comfortable inside the jacket. A two-way zipper at the front of the jacket gives you the option to unzip from either the top or bottom for optimal customized temperature regulation, and the stylish toggle-front closure that overlays the zippered placket features genuine buffalo horn toggles. The hood is removable if you prefer to wear the sweater alone on warmer days, and the real raccoon fur trim is also detachable, which allows you to customize the style of the jacket to suit your preference for the day. As becomes exceedingly apparent once you start to uncover the level of luxurious detail and technical prowess in this supremely soft and pretty jacket, you will realize that this is a winter coverup like no other.";s:8:"category";s:23:" track & active jackets";s:5:"price";s:6:"648.95";s:8:"merchant";s:11:"Backcountry";s:5:"brand";s:14:"Dale of Norway";s:9:"permalink";s:122:"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deiq/track-amp-active-jackets-10/dale-of-norway-svolver-jacket-women-s-off-white-s.html";}s:41:"dale-of-norway-jeger-vest-women-s-mocca-m";a:9:{s:13:"affiliate_url";s:163:"http://prosperent.com/store/product/406592-16240-0/?k=Dale+of+Norway+Jeger+Vest+-+Women%27s+Mocca%2C+M&m=123472&b=Dale+of+Norway&p=da9783b9524b8f8cff5c1d0fd51f9962";s:9:"image_url";s:104:"http://images.prosperentcdn.com/images/250x250/www.backcountry.com/images/items/1200/DON/DON000U/MOC.jpg";s:7:"keyword";s:44:"Dale of Norway Jeger Vest - Women's Mocca, M";s:11:"description";s:344:"The Dale of Norway Women's Jeger Vest takes an elegant nod toward the classic hunting vest.

The cooler weather and variable conditions can limit the time we're able to spend in the saddle, but cycling under a canopy of changing leaves on singletrack, enjoying the crisp morning air on your favorite road loop, or picking up new-crop squash at the farmer's market on a bright Saturday morning are among our greatest cycling pleasures. Fortunately, Gore Bike Wear has us covered with the Element Gore-Tex AS Jacket. You can find it at the intersection of price, layering, and functionality and hanging up in many of our closets. The Element AS Jacket is a true 2. 5-layer construction, which combines an outer layer that carries the color and reflective details, a Gore-Tex layer, and an inner, protective scrim that only really counts as half a layer since it's integrated in the Gore-Tex fabric. The Gore-Tex is the important part, as that's where the moisture and thermal management goes down: water out, warmth in. Gore intentionally adds the modifier durably to waterproof and windproof because this jacket won't lose its resistances over the course of a season's use and/or in the wash. Gore doesn't make fabric that lasts for years of intense use and cleaning that would strip other manufacturer's offerings of their protective properties. The jacket's fit varies from Gore-Tex's slimmer Power Jacket in that it's generous enough for some substantial thermal layering, so you can layer up when the temperature drops. It features two zippered front pockets for easy saddle-bound access, hook-and-loop fasteners for an optional hood (sold separately) , adjustable cuffs, and a cord-adjustable hem. Reflective highlights include piping for your collar bones, upper arms, and lower back, plus a Gore logo at the back hem to make you as visible as possible in low-light conditions. The 2. 5-layer construction means it's as lightweight and compactable as a waterproof jacket can be.
